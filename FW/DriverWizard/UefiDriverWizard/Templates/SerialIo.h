/**
  Sets the baud rate, receive FIFO depth, transmit/receice time out, parity, 
  data buts, and stop bits on a serial device.

  @param  This             Protocol instance pointer.
  @param  BaudRate         The requested baud rate. A BaudRate value of 0 will use the
                           device's default interface speed.
  @param  ReveiveFifoDepth The requested depth of the FIFO on the receive side of the
                           serial interface. A ReceiveFifoDepth value of 0 will use
                           the device's default FIFO depth.
  @param  Timeout          The requested time out for a single character in microseconds.
                           This timeout applies to both the transmit and receive side of the
                           interface. A Timeout value of 0 will use the device's default time
                           out value.
  @param  Parity           The type of parity to use on this serial device. A Parity value of
                           DefaultParity will use the device's default parity value.
  @param  DataBits         The number of data bits to use on the serial device. A DataBits
                           vaule of 0 will use the device's default data bit setting.
  @param  StopBits         The number of stop bits to use on this serial device. A StopBits
                           value of DefaultStopBits will use the device's default number of
                           stop bits.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS      The device was reset.
  @retval EFI_DEVICE_ERROR The serial device could not be reset.
